GNU Aspell is a Free and Open Source spell checker designed to eventually
replace Ispell. It can either be used as a library or as an independent 
spell checker. Its main feature is that it does a superior job of suggesting
possible replacements for a misspelled word than just about any other spell
checker out there for the English language. Unlike Ispell, Aspell can also
easily check documents in UTF-8 without having to use a special dictionary.
Aspell will also do its best to respect the current locale setting. Other
advantages over Ispell include support for using multiple dictionaries at
once and intelligently handling personal dictionaries when more than one
Aspell process is open at once.
