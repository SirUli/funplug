FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to MP3, but
lossless, meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss in quality.
This is similar to how Zip works, except with FLAC you will get much better
compression because it is designed specifically for audio, and you can play
back compressed FLAC files in your favorite player just like you would an
MP3 file.
