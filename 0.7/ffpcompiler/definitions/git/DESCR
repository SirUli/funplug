Git is a free & open source, distributed version control system designed to
handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full
revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central
server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do.
