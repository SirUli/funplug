Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms which
provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple threads of
execution (aka ``multithreading'') inside event-driven applications. All
threads run in the same address space of the server application, but each
thread has it's own individual program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask
and errno variable.
