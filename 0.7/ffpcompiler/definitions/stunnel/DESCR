The stunnel program is designed to work as an SSL encryption wrapper between
remote client and local (inetd-startable) or remote server. It can be used to
add SSL functionality to commonly used inetd daemons like POP2, POP3, and IMAP
servers without any changes in the programs' code. Stunnel uses OpenSSL
libraries for cryptography, so it supports whatever cryptographic algorithms
you compiled into your library.
